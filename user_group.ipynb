      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       The passwd command changes passwords for user accounts. A normal user\n",
      "       may only change the password for their own account, while the superuser\n",
      "       may change the password for any account.  passwd also changes the\n",
      "       account or associated password validity period.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Password Changes\n",
      "       The user is first prompted for their old password, if one is present.\n",
      "       This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored\n",
      "       password. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password.\n",
      "       The superuser is permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten\n",
      "       passwords may be changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "       After the password has been entered, password aging information is\n",
      "       checked to see if the user is permitted to change the password at this\n",
      "       time. If not, passwd refuses to change the password and exits.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The user is then prompted twice for a replacement password. The second\n",
      "       entry is compared against the first and both are required to match in\n",
      "       order for the password to be changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Then, the password is tested for complexity. As a general guideline,\n",
      "       passwords should consist of 6 to 8 characters including one or more\n",
      "       characters from each of the following sets:\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   lower case alphabetics\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   digits 0 thru 9\n",
      "\n",
      "       •   punctuation marks\n",
      "\n",
      "       Care must be taken not to include the system default erase or kill\n",
      "       characters.  passwd will reject any password which is not suitably\n",
      "       complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Hints for user passwords\n",
      "       The security of a password depends upon the strength of the encryption\n",
      "       algorithm and the size of the key space. The legacy UNIX System\n",
      "       encryption method is based on the NBS DES algorithm. More recent\n",
      "       methods are now recommended (see ENCRYPT_METHOD). The size of the key\n",
      "       space depends upon the randomness of the password which is selected.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Compromises in password security normally result from careless password\n",
      "       selection or handling. For this reason, you should not select a\n",
      "       password which appears in a dictionary or which must be written down.\n",
      "       The password should also not be a proper name, your license number,\n",
      "       birth date, or street address. Any of these may be used as guesses to\n",
      "       violate system security.\n",
